## About
I am a PhD student (DPhil) in the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) research group within the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).

I will be joining Apple's [Machine Learning Research (MLR)](https://machinelearning.apple.com) group, led by [Samy Bengio](https://bengio.abracadoudou.com), as a full-time research scientist from September 2023 in the Paris team, led by [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net).

### Research Interests
I am interested in developing methodology at the intersection of: sampling methods, optimal transport and deep learning. I am particularly focused on dynamically evolving probability measures through filtering and diffusion models, especially through my work on the [Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/schrodinger_bridge).

I was one of the early advocates of diffusion models and maintain a website of diffusion/score papers: [https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/](https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/).

## Before academia
Prior to Oxford, I worked in a modelling and analytics role for investment management firm, BlackRock. I completed my undergraduate and Master's studies in Statistics at Warwick University where I worked with [Anthony Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/anthonylee/supervision) on Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian non-parametric models.
