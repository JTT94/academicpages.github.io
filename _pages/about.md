## About
I am a PhD student (DPhil) in the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) research group within the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).

### Research Interests
I am interested in developing methodology at the intersection sampling methods, Optimal Transport and deep learning. I am particularly interested in diffusion/ score based generative models and its connection to Optimal transport with the Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge. I maintain a website of papers in this area: [https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/](https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/).

### Research Placements
- [Nvidia Learning and Perception Research Team](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), 2022. I am currently interning with Jiaming Song, Ben Eckhart, and Arash Vahdat, working on diffusion probabilistic generative models. 
- [Apple Machine Learning Resarch](https://machinelearning.apple.com/), 2022. I undertook a research internship with [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) working on [improving the efficiency of Sinkhorn via initializations](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/2022-init-sink) and open sourced this to [OTT](https://github.com/ott-jax/ott). 
- Astrazeneca, 2021. I undertook an applied research project with Dino Oglic in the respiratory AI team, focusing on audio detection using deep attention based architectures, including implementing and investigating the use of PerceiverIO.


## Highlighted Publications
Below are some papers I am particularly proud of:

- [Riemannian Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/2022-rdsb), ICML Continuous time methods in ML, 2022
- [Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge and Score Based Generative Modeling](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/schrodinger_bridge), Spotlight NeurIPS 2021 (spotlight)
- [Differentiable Particle Filtering via Optimal Transport](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/2020-differentiable-particle-filtering), ICML 2021 (oral/ long talk)

## Before academia
Prior to Oxford, I worked in a modelling and analytics role for investment management firm, BlackRock. I completed my undergraduate and Master's studies in Statistics at Warwick University where I worked with [Anthony Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/anthonylee/supervision) on Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian non-parametric models.
