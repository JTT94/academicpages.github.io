PhD student in the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) research group within the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/) (Oxford) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) (DeepMind/ Oxford). I am interested in developing new methodology at the intersection of Monte Carlo sampling, Optimal Transport and machine learning.

Prior to Oxford, I worked in a modelling and analytics role for investment management firm, BlackRock. I completed my undergraduate and Master's studies in Statistics at Warwick University where I worked with [Anthony Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/anthonylee/supervision) on Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian non-parametric models.
