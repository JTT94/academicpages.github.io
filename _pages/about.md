## About
I will he joining Google DeepMind as a research scientist from March. 

I wasa research scientist within the [Machine Learning Research (MLR)](https://machinelearning.apple.com) group at Apple beforehand.

Prior to Apple, I did my PhD (DPhil) in the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) research group within the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).

My PhD thesis is available [here](https://github.com/JTT94/jtt94.github.io/raw/master/files/thesis.pdf).


### Research Interests
I am interested in developing methodology at the intersection of: sampling methods, optimal transport and deep learning. I am particularly focused on dynamically evolving probability measures through filtering and diffusion models. 

Notable work includes connecting diffusion models to optimal transport through the [Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/schrodinger_bridge), which was one of the first image-to-image diffusion models, its extension to the [Riemannian setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03024); and [Differentiable Particle Filtering](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/2020-differentiable-particle-filtering), which provides a theoretically grounded approach to the long standing problem of parameter learning in state-space models. For an up-to-date list of works please see [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=oFZHOwgAAAAJ&hl=en).

I was one of the early advocates of diffusion models and maintain a website of diffusion/score papers: [https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/](https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/).

## Before academia
Prior to Oxford, I worked in a modelling and analytics role for investment management firm, BlackRock. I completed my undergraduate and Master's studies in Statistics at Warwick University where I worked with [Anthony Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/anthonylee/supervision) on Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian non-parametric models.
