## About
I am a PhD student (DPhil) in the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) research group within the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/) and [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).

I will be joining Apple's [Machine Learning Research (MLR)](https://machinelearning.apple.com) group, led by Samy Bengio, as a full-time research scientist from September 2023 in the Paris team, led by [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net).

### Research Interests
I am interested in developing methodology at the intersection of: sampling methods, optimal transport and deep learning. I am particularly focused on dynamically evolving probability measures through filtering, diffusion models and applications in time-series, generative modeling and dataset interpolation. 

I was one of the early advocates of diffusion models and maintain a website of diffusion/score papers: [https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/](https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/).

Below are some recent papers I am particularly proud of:
- [Riemannian Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/2022-rdsb), ICML Continuous time methods in ML, 2022 \
(Split from main paper Riemannian Score Based Generative Modelling - NeurIPS 2022, outstanding paper award)
- [Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge and Score Based Generative Modeling](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/schrodinger_bridge), NeurIPS 2021 (spotlight)
- [Differentiable Particle Filtering via Optimal Transport](https://jtt94.github.io/papers/2020-differentiable-particle-filtering), ICML 2021 (oral/ long talk)

## Before academia
Prior to Oxford, I worked in a modelling and analytics role for investment management firm, BlackRock. I completed my undergraduate and Master's studies in Statistics at Warwick University where I worked with [Anthony Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/anthonylee/supervision) on Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian non-parametric models.
