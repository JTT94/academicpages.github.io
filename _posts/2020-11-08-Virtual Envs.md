Virtual environments are a convenient way to manage library dependencies, environment variables, and ensure reproducibility. There are a couple of approaches to this: `virtualenv`,`conda`, and `docker` -- see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/guide-of-choosing-package-management-tool-for-data-science-project-809a093efd46) for a discussion. This post will focus on `conda`, and give a few practical commands to get up and running.

- Download and install miniconda 
```
sh curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -o "$conda_dir/miniconda.sh"
sh -x miniconda.sh -b -p "./miniconda3" 
```

**Note:** The default conda set-up requires editing the .bashrc file and setting environment variables to point to the conda executable. This is a pain when dealing with multiple servers, fortunately there are ways around this and the commands given here will not rely on editing the .bashrc.

## Basic commands
- **Create environment called conda_venv, for Python version 3.8** \
```./miniconda3/bin/conda create -n conda_venv python=3.8```
- **Activate environment** \
```source ./miniconda3/bin/activate conda_venv```
- **De-activate environment** \
```conda deactivate conda_venv```\
This adds the environment executables such as Python, pip and conda to the executable path.
- **Install/ uninstall:** (once env is activated)
  - Through conda: `conda install -c anaconda numpy`
  - Through pip: `pip install numpy` \
**Note:** this pip executable will be installed when installing python, and the libraries installed via pip will be specific to the conda environment and not the global environment

- **Export installed dependencies to file**\
```conda env export > env.yaml```

- **Install dependencies from file**: this is actually creating an environment from a yaml file, so no need to create an empty env first
```conda env create -f environment.yml```

## Conda environments with jupyter notebook
- **Make sure jupyter is installed** \
`pip install jupyter`
- ***Add kernel for environment*** \
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=conda_venv`
