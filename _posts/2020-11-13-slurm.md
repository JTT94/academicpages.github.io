[slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is a resouce manager for running compute jobs across multiple servers. Although this has the benefit of additional control, it imposes constraints on compute resources and constrains interaction with servers to the slurm interface.

This post aims to be a useful go-to guide to common slurm commands and examples of how slurm may be used without the pain.
